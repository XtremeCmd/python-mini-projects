# python-mini-projects
“A collection of small Python projects built while learning Python, OOP, and DSA.”

-1.Daily Expense Calulator:- This project calculates all your daily expenses, it uses these topics 1. variables 2. data types 3. input and output 4. basic operations. 

-2. Text Analysis:- Uses string and string methods to analyze given string, it uses these topics 1. string 2. string slicing 3. string methods. 

-3. To do List:- Uses List and List methods to maintain a to do list, it uses these topics 1. List and List methods 2. While loop 3. match and case 4. continue and break keywords.

-4. Students marks analyzer:- It takes in student names, and their marks and stores it in dictionaries and also analyzes the max marks. it uses topics like 1. dictionaries 2. tuples 3. sets 4. dictionary, tuple and set methods.

-5. Password Analyzer:- It takes user input for password and then gives it a score as weak, medium or strong, it uses topics of conditional loops like for loop and while loop.

-6. Recursive Calculator:- Takes two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, mutliplication or division. It uses the topics of 1. input, 2. function 3. recursion. 

-7. Student grade analyzer:- this project uses the topic of list comprehension and conditionals to grade students as per the marks scored by them.

-8. Stack using list:- This project uses list as stack, and with the help of functions, we are able to achieve the operations of a stack like push, pop, peek, etc. Follow First In Last Out Principle (FILO).

-8.5 Queue using list:- This is quite similar to the stack project, with the slight change of function names and follows the First In First Out Principle (FIFO).

-9. Music playlist analyzer:- Analysis songs based on their rating and return a list of highest rated songs along with duration of the playlist, super useful while making a playlist. It uses the topics of 1. List comprehension 2. Reduce 3. Map 4. Filter.

-10. Bank Account using oop:- A bank account program that can perform functions like deposit and withdraw using the simplest of OOPs concepts like classes and objects.

-11. Encapsulated Bank Account:- This program is similar to the previous program but with the extesion of encapsulation. 

-12. Vehicle rental service:- Uses all concepts of Object Oriented Programming, especially the four pillars of OOP i.e, Encapsulation 2. Polymorphism 3. Inheritance 4. Abstraction. One project to contain them ALL. 

-13. age checker program:- uses a made up class of age can't be negative and extends to the Exception class, this program also uses the try and except keywords to handle the error that is being raised.

-14. matrix algebra program:- This program takes two 3 x 3 standard matrices as input and performs four matrix operations, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication and determinant all using the Numpy library.

-15. Students marks analysis using numpy:- This program uses a 2-d numpy array, with rows representing students and columns representing marks scored by those students. It analyzes mean, max, min, average marks of the students, average marks per subject, and lots of other things.
